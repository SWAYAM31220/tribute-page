        Alan Turing was an English mathematician, computer scientist, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher, and theoretical biologist. He is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence. During World War II, Turing worked for the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park, Britain's codebreaking center. He played a pivotal role in cracking the German Enigma code.
